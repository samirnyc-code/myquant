## Primary Tick Data — Sierra Charts (Delani)

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Provider | Sierra Charts via Delani |
| Instrument | ES (E-mini S&P 500 futures) |
| Format | `.scid` binary files (Sierra Charts native tick format) |
| Data directory | `C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\NT Code Versions\ChartMarker_Files\Data\` |
| Coverage | ESU23–ESZ25 — 12 quarterly contracts confirmed on disk |
| Session | RTH: 08:30–15:15 CT (confirmed from ESM6 tick data; applied as filter in loader) |
| Rollover | One `.scid` file per quarterly contract. Python loads multiple quarters and concatenates. No stitching needed — just select quarter range. |
| Status | ✅ Parser built and working |

### Confirmed Binary Format (`s_IntradayRecord`)

| Field | Offset | Type | Detail |
|-------|--------|------|--------|
| Header | 0 | 56 bytes | Fixed file header |
| `DateTime` | 0 | int64 | Microseconds since 1899-12-30 00:00:00 UTC |
| `Open` | 8 | float32 | |
| `High` | 12 | float32 | |
| `Low` | 16 | float32 | |
| `Close` | 20 | float32 | Last trade price |
| `NumTrades` | 24 | int32 | |
| `TotalVolume` | 28 | int32 | |
| `BidVolume` | 32 | int32 | |
| `AskVolume` | 36 | int32 | |
| Record size | — | 40 bytes | |

**Timestamp conversion:**
```python
SC_EPOCH = pd.Timestamp("1899-12-30")
dt_utc = SC_EPOCH + pd.to_timedelta(raw_microseconds, unit="us")
dt_ct  = dt_utc.tz_localize("UTC").tz_convert("America/Chicago").tz_localize(None)
```

**Parser location:** `data_loader.py` — `build_scid_quarter_map()`, `load_scid_ticks_chunked()`, `parse_scid_ticks_from_upload()`

**Parquet cache:** `SCID_DATA_DIR/_scid_cache/ticks.parquet` (snappy) + `meta.json`. Auto-loaded on app startup. Functions: `save_scid_cache()`, `load_scid_cache()`, `clear_scid_cache()`.

**Open question — bar timestamp direction:** It is not yet confirmed whether the SCID `DateTime` field represents bar **open** or bar **close** time. NT TXT exports use bar close time (bar 1 = 08:35 row). If SCID also uses close time, bar 1 ticks resample into the [08:35, 08:40) bin → displayed as bar 2. Fix would be to subtract 5 min before resampling. **Do not apply until verified.** See `open_questions.md`.

## Secondary Tick Data — Massive.io (Optional)

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Provider | Massive.io |
| Plan needed | Futures Advanced or Futures Business CME |
| Instrument | ES quarterly contracts: ESH, ESM, ESU, ESZ |
| Format | Daily flat files, one tick per line, Last price only |
| Timestamp | Milliseconds since epoch |
| Fields | timestamp, ticker, price, volume |
| Coverage | Back to 2017 |
| Status | Not purchased |
| Purpose | Cross-provider analysis validation only — not primary research data |

**Decision:** Purchase only after Sierra Charts data is validated and Python sim is producing results. Massive data will be used to verify that WFA conclusions from Sierra data hold up on an independent data source. It is not required to build the sim.

## Live Trading Data — NT8 / Rithmic

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Platform | NinjaTrader 8 |
| Feed | Rithmic |
| Instrument | ES / MES |
| Available | 1 year of tick data on disk |
| Purpose | Cross-provider bar validation — compare NT8/Rithmic bars against Sierra bars |
| Status | Available now |

---

## Data Architecture

```

        |
        ├── Validate against NT8/Rithmic 5M bars (bar_validation.md — Gate 2)
        |
        v

(do WFA conclusions on Sierra data hold on Massive data?)

## Why Tick Data Differs Between Providers

Same underlying CME feed, different results. Sources of divergence:

1. **Timestamp granularity** — Sierra: microseconds. Massive: milliseconds. Same tick, potentially different bar boundary.
2. **Tick filtering** — each provider applies their own bad tick filter. A tick Sierra accepts, Massive or Rithmic may reject.
3. **Packet bundling** — CME sends ticks in UDP packets. Providers unbundle and timestamp differently.
4. **Rollover handling** — quarterly contract stitching logic differs per provider. Biggest source of multi-year divergence.
5. **Connection latency** — sub-millisecond differences in tick receipt change bar boundary assignment.

**Consequence:** OHLCV bars will be close but never identical across providers. 1-tick differences on boundary bars are expected and acceptable. Systematic bias is not. See `bar_validation.md` for tolerance thresholds.

**Solution:** Strategy robustness is the primary defense against feed variance. A strategy with strong WFE across 10+ years of Sierra data absorbs 1-tick bar differences on Rithmic. The bar validation gates confirm the feeds are compatible. They do not need to be identical.

## Open Questions

- [ ] **SCID bar timestamp direction** — does `DateTime` represent bar open or bar close? NT TXT uses close. If SCID uses close, bar numbering is off by 1 in the Streamlit app. Verify by comparing SCID tick first bar timestamp against a known NT bar. See `open_questions.md` Q14.
- [ ] SC session exact template — confirmed 08:30–15:15 CT from data, but not verified against SC session settings directly
- [ ] Massive.io — purchase decision deferred until Sierra sim is producing results
